Semantic Document Question Answering with LangChain &amp; Vector Search
Developed a question-answering system leveraging a large language model (LLM) for intelligent document querying. Designed and implemented an architecture integrating LangChain for LLM orchestration and Pinecone as a vector database to enable efficient semantic search. Evaluated and optimized the systemâ€™s performance through testing on diverse documents to improve the accuracy and relevance of answers.
